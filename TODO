Why CIB?
    * somebody doesn't run the tests
    * you may have local changes that don't get checked in (p4 add anyone?)
    * constant feedback to everybody about status of the code
    * verify one piece of software works with another
        * builds can trigger one or more other builds
    * automate, automate, automate
